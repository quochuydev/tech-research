Read the file at $ARGUMENTS and analyze it as an engineer. Generate practical earning opportunities based on the technical knowledge.

Structure your response as:

## Low-Barrier Entry
Table with: Idea | Why It Works | Skills Needed

## Builder Opportunities
Categorized list of products/services that can be built

## Higher Technical Bar
Table with: Idea | Opportunity (for more complex ventures)

## Quick Wins
Numbered list of immediate actions with low effort

## Technical Advantages to Leverage
Table mapping: Feature | Earning Opportunity

Include relevant resources and links at the end.

Focus on practical, actionable ideas. Prioritize by effort-to-reward ratio.

**IMPORTANT**: After generating the analysis, write the output to a markdown file in the same directory as the input file. Name it by replacing `-overview.md` with `-earning-ideas.md` (e.g., `researching/deepwiki-overview.md` → `researching/deepwiki-earning-ideas.md`). If the input filename doesn't end with `-overview.md`, append `-earning-ideas.md` to the base filename.
