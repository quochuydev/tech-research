## Low-Barrier Entry

| Idea | Why It Works | Skills Needed |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| **YouTube Tutorial Series** | MediaPipe has 15+ solutions but limited quality tutorials; sub-millisecond performance demos are visually impressive | Python, screen recording, basic ML concepts |
| **Fitness Rep Counter App** | Pose estimation (33 landmarks) enables automatic rep counting; fitness apps command premium prices | JavaScript/Python, MediaPipe Pose, basic UI |
| **Virtual Background Web App** | Selfie segmentation runs <3ms on GPU; Zoom-style backgrounds without subscription | JavaScript, MediaPipe Image Segmentation |
| **Hand Gesture Mouse Control** | 21 hand landmarks enable precise gesture mapping; accessibility market underserved | Python, MediaPipe Hands, system input APIs |
| **Face Filter Instagram Clone** | 478 face landmarks + 52 blendshapes enable Snapchat-quality filters; open source = no licensing | JavaScript, Three.js/WebGL, MediaPipe Face |
| **Sign Language Translator** | Hand + pose landmarks cover ASL alphabet; accessibility grants available | Python, MediaPipe Holistic, ML classification |
| **Freelance Integration Services** | Many businesses need MediaPipe added to existing apps; documentation is complex | Python/JavaScript, MediaPipe SDK, consulting |
