# Repository: agentation

**Stars:** 102 | **Forks:** 10 | **Created:** January 18, 2026 | **Time to 100 stars:** ~4 days

**URL:** https://github.com/benjitaylor/agentation
**Website:** https://agentation.dev

## Overview

Agentation is a visual feedback tool for AI coding agents. It allows developers to click elements on their webpage, add notes, and copy structured Markdown output that helps AI tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf) find the exact code being referenced.

**Tagline:** "The visual feedback tool for agents."

## Why It's Growing

### 1. Credible Creator with Track Record
Benji Taylor is a notable figure in the developer tools space:
- **Current:** Head of Design at Base (Coinbase)
- **Previous:** CPO at Aave Labs, SVP of Product & Design at Avara
- **Creator of:** ConnectKit (1k+ stars), the popular wallet connection library for React
- **Founded:** Los Feliz Engineering (Family wallet, Honk app)

This credibility likely drives organic discovery and trust from the developer community.

### 2. Perfect Timing - "Vibe Coding" Wave
The repo was created on January 18, 2026, during the peak of the "vibe coding" movement:
- AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf) are mainstream
- Developers actively seeking tools to improve human-AI communication
- The term "vibe coding" is trending in developer circles
- Direct competitor "Vibe Annotations" validates the market need

### 3. Solves a Real Pain Point
The value proposition is immediately clear:
> "Eliminates vague descriptions by providing AI agents with precise selectors and element positions—transforming 'the blue button in the sidebar' into actionable `.sidebar > button.primary` references."

This directly addresses a frustration every AI-assisted developer experiences.

### 4. Strong Technical Execution
- Zero external dependencies (beyond React)
- TypeScript-first
- Clean, simple API: just add `<Agentation />` component
- Works with any AI tool (agent-agnostic)

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitor: Vibe Annotations
- **URL:** https://www.vibe-annotations.com/
- **Approach:** Browser extension + MCP server
- **Key difference:** Works on any website (not just your app)
- **Status:** Featured on Product Hunt, open source

### Agentation's Differentiators
1. **Embedded approach** - Component lives in your app
2. **Zero config** - No browser extension or MCP setup needed
3. **Creator credibility** - Benji Taylor's track record
4. **Simpler architecture** - Just a React component

## Recommendations for Similar Projects

### Immediate Actions

1. **Add a Demo GIF to README**
   - Record a 15-30 second workflow showing: hover → click → annotate → copy → paste to AI
   - This single addition could double GitHub engagement

2. **Launch on Product Hunt**
   - The category is proven (competitor already featured)
   - Leverage Benji's existing network for upvotes
   - Timing is perfect with current AI coding momentum

3. **Tweet Thread Announcement**
   - Structure: Problem → Solution → Demo GIF → Link
   - Tag @cursor_ai, @windsurf_ai, @AnthropicAI for amplification
   - Developer Twitter is hungry for productivity tools

### Medium-Term Growth

4. **Create Comparison Content**
   - "Agentation vs Vibe Annotations: When to use each"
   - Honest comparison content ranks well and builds trust

5. **Write a Dev.to/Medium Article**
   - "How I eliminated 'the blue button' from my AI prompts"
   - Include before/after examples with real screenshots

6. **Submit to Hacker News**
   - Frame as "Show HN" with personal story
   - Best time: Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10am EST
   - Title: "Show HN: Visual feedback for AI coding agents"

7. **Integration Tutorials**
   - "Using Agentation with Claude Code"
   - "Agentation + Cursor: Complete workflow guide"
   - These become evergreen SEO content

### Leverage Creator's Network

8. **Cross-promote via ConnectKit**
   - 1k+ stars = established audience
   - Even a GitHub bio update drives discovery

9. **Coinbase/Base Developer Community**
   - Share in internal channels (if appropriate)
   - Base has an active developer community interested in tooling

## Growth Trajectory Analysis

### Current State
- 102 stars in ~4 days = ~25 stars/day average
- 10 forks indicates developer interest in contributing/customizing
- Active development (commits from today)
- 5 issues, 17 PRs shows community engagement beginning

### Projection
Without active promotion:
- Likely to plateau at 200-500 stars (organic discovery ceiling)

With strategic promotion (Product Hunt + HN + Twitter):
- Potential to reach 1-2k stars within first month
- Could become the "default" tool in the category given creator credibility

### Critical Success Factor
The biggest unlock would be **official integration or endorsement** from:
- Anthropic (Claude Code)
- Cursor team
- Windsurf team

Any of these would provide exponential growth similar to how MCPs boosted related tools.

## Summary

Agentation is a well-executed tool solving a real problem, created by someone with significant credibility in the developer tools space. Its modest 100-star growth in 4 days came almost entirely from organic discovery—no visible marketing effort.

The opportunity is significant: with proper promotion (demo GIF, Product Hunt launch, HN submission, Twitter announcement), this could easily 10x its star count. The "vibe coding" trend is at its peak, the competitive landscape is still forming, and the creator has the network to amplify effectively.

**Bottom line:** Good product, bad marketing. Fix the marketing and this becomes a category-defining tool.
