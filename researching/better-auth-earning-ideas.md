|------|--------------|---------------|
| **Better Auth Tutorial Content** | New library (Sep 2024) with massive growth - docs gaps exist for specific framework combos | Technical writing, any supported framework |
| **YouTube Integration Tutorials** | "Better Auth + Next.js 15" or "Better Auth + SvelteKit" videos get search traffic from devs evaluating auth | Video production, one framework expertise |
| **Migration Guides** | Devs need "NextAuth to Better Auth" or "Lucia to Better Auth" guides - Lucia is deprecated | Experience with both libraries |
| **Starter Templates on GitHub** | High-quality starters with Better Auth + Prisma/Drizzle + Tailwind get stars and traffic | Full-stack TypeScript |
| **Discord Community Support** | 6K+ member Discord - establish expertise, get consulting leads | Better Auth practical experience |
