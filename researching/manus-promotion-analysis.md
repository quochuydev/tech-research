## Case Study: planning-with-files

**Repository:** [OthmanAdi/planning-with-files](https://github.com/OthmanAdi/planning-with-files)
**Stars:** 4.7k in 5 days
**Created:** January 3, 2026

## Why It Went Viral

### 1. News Jacking Strategy

Meta acquired Manus for $2B on December 29, 2025. The repo was created just 5 days later with a description that directly references:

> "Claude Code skill implementing Manus-style persistent markdown planning — the workflow pattern behind the $2B acquisition."

This created immediate curiosity and FOMO among developers.

### 2. Perfect Timing

- Posted during "The Great Coding Agent Race" week
- Context engineering was trending topic
- Multiple related repos gaining traction simultaneously
- Claude Code ecosystem rapidly growing

### 3. Confirmed Promotion Channels

### 4. Viral-Ready Format
