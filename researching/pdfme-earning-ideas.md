pdfme is a TypeScript-based PDF generation library with a React UI template editor. It uses JSON-based templates for document creation with high-performance generation (tens to hundreds of milliseconds).

## Low-Barrier Entry

| Idea | Why It Works | Skills Needed |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| **PDF template marketplace** | Businesses need ready-made templates (invoices, contracts, certificates); pdfme's JSON format makes templates portable | Basic TypeScript, UI design |
| **Template conversion service** | Convert existing PDF templates to pdfme format for companies migrating | PDF understanding, pdfme schemas |
| **YouTube tutorial series** | 4K stars but limited tutorial content; "pdfme tutorial" has low competition | Screen recording, basic React |
| **Custom schema development** | Plugin architecture allows selling specialized schemas (signatures, charts, tables) | TypeScript, pdf-lib knowledge |
| **Freelance integration work** | Many SaaS apps need PDF generation; pdfme is lighter than alternatives | React/Node.js, API integration |

## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | pdfme Advantage |
|------------|-----------------|
| **jsPDF** | pdfme has visual template designer; jsPDF is code-only |
| **pdfkit** | pdfme runs in browser; pdfkit is Node-only |
| **Puppeteer/Playwright** | pdfme is faster, lighter; no headless browser overhead |
| **DocRaptor/PDFShift** | pdfme is free, self-hosted; they charge per document |
| **React-PDF** | pdfme has form input + generation; React-PDF is display-only |
