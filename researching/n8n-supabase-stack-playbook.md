# n8n + Supabase: Business Development Playbook

## The Stack

| Component | Role | Cost |
|-----------|------|------|
| **n8n** | Visual workflow automation engine | Free self-hosted / $20+/mo cloud |
| **Supabase** | Backend-as-a-Service (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage + Realtime) | Free tier / $25+/mo |

---

## Market Opportunity

### The Problem You're Solving

Businesses waste **$1.8 trillion annually** on repetitive manual tasks. They need:
- Connect apps that don't talk to each other (CRM → Email → Slack → Sheets)
- Automate workflows without hiring developers
- Own their data (not locked into Zapier/Make.com)

### Target Market Size

| Segment | Size | Willingness to Pay |
|---------|------|-------------------|
| Small businesses (1-50 employees) | 33M in US alone | $50-500/mo for automation |
| Agencies & consultants | 1.4M in US | $1,000-10,000/project |
| Startups needing MVPs | 5M globally | $2,000-20,000/project |
| Enterprise departments | Fortune 5000 | $5,000-50,000/project |

### Why Now?

1. **AI explosion** - Every business wants "AI automation" but doesn't know how
2. **Zapier fatigue** - $50/mo for 750 tasks is expensive; n8n is unlimited
3. **Data privacy regulations** - Self-hosted = GDPR/HIPAA compliant
4. **No-code plateau** - Businesses hit limits, need custom solutions

## Competitive Positioning

### Direct Competitors

| Competitor | Weakness You Exploit |
|------------|---------------------|
| **Zapier** | $588/yr for 2,000 tasks; n8n is unlimited |
| **Make.com** | Complex UI; you offer done-for-you |
| **Integromat** | No self-hosting; you offer data ownership |
| **Custom dev** | $150/hr; you deliver in days, not months |

### Your Unique Value Proposition

> "Enterprise-grade automation at 10% of the cost, delivered in days not months, with full data ownership."

## Go-To-Market Strategy

### Phase 1: Validation (Week 1-2)

**Goal**: Get first 3 paying clients

1. **Identify pain points** - Join Facebook groups, Reddit (r/smallbusiness, r/entrepreneur)
2. **Offer free audits** - "I'll analyze your workflow and show you 3 automations that save 10+ hrs/week"
3. **Convert to paid** - "I can build this for $X, done in Y days"

**Outreach script:**
> "Hey [Name], I noticed you're using [Tool A] and [Tool B]. Most businesses I work with save 10-15 hours/week by connecting these automatically. Want me to show you how? Free 15-min audit."

### Phase 2: Systematize (Month 1-2)

**Goal**: Repeatable process, 10+ clients

1. **Document your workflows** - Create templates for common automations
2. **Build case studies** - "Saved Client X 20 hrs/week, ROI in 2 weeks"
3. **Create packages** - Productize your most common builds
4. **Raise prices** - You have proof now

### Phase 3: Scale (Month 3-6)

**Goal**: $10k+/month revenue

| Channel | Action | Expected Result |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| **Content marketing** | Weekly YouTube/blog on automation | Inbound leads |
| **Partnerships** | Partner with agencies, consultants | Referral revenue |
| **Templates** | Sell pre-built workflows | Passive income |
| **Hiring** | Train VA to handle simple builds | 3x capacity |

### Phase 4: Productize (Month 6-12)

**Goal**: Recurring SaaS revenue

- Identify your most-requested workflow
- Build as standalone product with Supabase backend
- Offer self-serve + managed options
- Target: $5-20k MRR

## Pricing Psychology

### Value-Based Pricing Framework

**Never price by hours. Price by value.**

| Client saves | You charge | Their ROI |
|--------------|------------|-----------|
| 10 hrs/week × $30/hr = $1,200/mo | $500 one-time | 240% in month 1 |
| 1 employee worth of work = $4,000/mo | $2,000 one-time | 200% in month 1 |
| Prevents $10k/yr in errors | $3,000 one-time | 333% in year 1 |

### Anchor Pricing

Always present 3 options:

| Tier | Price | Psychology |
|------|-------|------------|
| Basic | $500 | "Too limited" |
| **Professional** | **$1,500** | **"Just right" - most choose this** |
| Enterprise | $5,000 | Makes $1,500 look reasonable |

## Customer Acquisition Channels

### Highest ROI Channels (Ranked)

| Channel | Cost | Time to First Client | Quality |
|---------|------|---------------------|---------|
| **Cold outreach** (LinkedIn, email) | Free | 1-2 weeks | High |
| **Referrals** | Free | 2-4 weeks | Highest |
| **Content** (YouTube, blog) | Free | 2-3 months | High |
| **Communities** (Facebook, Reddit, Discord) | Free | 2-4 weeks | Medium |
| **Upwork/Fiverr** | 20% fee | 1 week | Low-Medium |
| **Paid ads** | $500+/mo | 1-2 weeks | Medium |

### Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

**Best clients:**
- 5-50 employees (big enough to pay, small enough to decide fast)
- Using 5+ SaaS tools (more integration pain)
- Non-technical founder/ops lead (can't DIY)
- Growing 20%+/year (have budget, feel pain)

**Industries with highest demand:**
1. E-commerce (Shopify + inventory + shipping + email)
2. Real estate (CRM + listings + email + documents)
3. Agencies (client reporting + project management)
4. SaaS companies (user onboarding + analytics + support)
5. Healthcare (patient intake + scheduling + compliance)

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Client can't pay | 50% upfront, 50% on delivery |
| Scope creep | Fixed-scope packages with clear deliverables |
| n8n goes down | Self-host on reliable VPS (Hetzner, DigitalOcean) |
| Competition | Build relationships, not just automations |
| Technical issues | Document everything, create SOPs |
